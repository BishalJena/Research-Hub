AI-Enabled Research Support and Publication Enhancement Platform for GDCs

AI-powered academic support system to automate topic discovery, literature review, plagiarism detection, and journal recommendations for Government Degree Colleges (GDCs).

Theme: AI for Higher Education and Research Productivity
Department: Collegiate Education Department, Government of Andhra Pradesh

Challenge Teaser

Empower educators and researchers in GDCs with AI.
Develop a multilingual platform that recommends trending research topics, automates literature reviews, ensures originality, and suggests suitable journals — helping faculty and students produce globally visible, high-quality research.

Challenge Overview

Despite substantial academic talent within Government Degree Colleges (GDCs) in Andhra Pradesh, research productivity and publication quality remain low. Most faculty and postgraduate researchers lack access to structured research guidance tools and spend excessive time manually identifying topics, reviewing literature, formatting citations, and selecting journals.
This leads to limited research output, scattered themes, and weak global visibility for the state’s academic contributions. The Collegiate Education Department aims to introduce an AI-enabled Research Support Platform that acts as an intelligent assistant to streamline all research stages — from topic discovery and literature synthesis to plagiarism detection and journal selection.
The platform will provide context-aware suggestions using public academic databases, ensure research originality, and offer multilingual accessibility (Telugu, Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu, and English).

 

Expected Solution

Participants are invited to develop a multilingual AI-based platform incorporating the following key modules:

AI-Powered Topic Selection: Recommend high-impact and trending research areas aligned with academic disciplines, societal relevance, and regional needs using NLP and citation analysis.
AI-Driven Literature Review Automation: Summarize uploaded academic papers, extract key insights, identify related works, and auto-organize references using natural language understanding (NLU).
AI-Based Citation and Plagiarism Detection: Suggest accurate citations from trusted academic repositories and detect similarity patterns to prevent plagiarism, providing originality scores for compliance.
AI-Powered Journal Recommendation Engine: Analyze paper abstracts and recommend suitable journals based on:
Open access vs. paid journals
Indexing (Scopus, Web of Science, peer-reviewed)
Time to publish, subject domain, impact factor, and H-index metrics.
Integration Layer: Seamless API integration with the APCCE (https://apcce.gov.in) portal for authentication and access to GDC researcher profiles.
 

Outcomes

Increased research productivity among faculty and students.
Improved quality and global visibility of publications from GDCs.
Enhanced compliance with academic integrity standards.
Reduced time spent on manual research documentation and citation tasks.
 

Expected Impact

Faculty and Researchers: Access to AI-assisted, structured research workflows improving output quality.
Academic Institutions: Increased publication rates and visibility in national and international journals.
Government: Establishment of Andhra Pradesh as a leader in AI-enabled higher education and research innovation.
Dataset Access

Participants will have access to open and public-domain datasets such as:

Academic Repositories: Open-access databases (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, etc.)
Journal Metadata: Indexed journal data (Scopus, Web of Science).
Sample Research Papers: Provided for algorithm training and testing.
Researcher Profiles: Synthetic faculty and student metadata for validation.
Proof of Concept (PoC) Scope

Testing base: 8 users (faculty and researchers) from Government Degree Colleges.
Duration: 2 months.
Languages supported: Telugu, Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu, and English.
 

Proof of Concept (PoC) Success Criteria

≥80% accuracy in topic recommendation and journal matching based on user feedback.
Effective literature review summarization and plagiarism detection.
Smooth integration with the APCCE portal and AI performance across supported languages.
 

Data Privacy and Compliance

All research data and user content must comply with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023.
The system must ensure user consent, secure data storage, encryption, and limited access as per role-based permissions.
